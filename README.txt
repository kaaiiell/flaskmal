This is a Web Application that Pulls data from the Jinkan Application
to display anime information for the current season or based on the 
options selected.

Attemped to use Youtube API, however the amount of call I want always
go over the free user limit. So I resolved issue by just adding my 
search query, that was pulled from the API, diretcly to the youtube 
search url.
